# MLOps with Databricks in Public Clouds

**DEV REPO**

Associated with EC 528 at Boston University  
Group 11

# Purpose

This repo is simply an environment for me to experiment with using new features (new to me) of GitHub repos. One of our tasks is exploring DevOps (i.e., code operations) on Databricks. We have a shared repo for the class, but I didn't want to accidentally clutter that repo with problems.

# More specific

This repo is meant to be a "developement" environment where developers would create their own clone of this repo (and maybe a branch too), then develop and experiment with writing code. Branches would allow multiple people to work on developing code, then push updates that can be pulled to the main branch where everyone's 'dev' code is stored.
