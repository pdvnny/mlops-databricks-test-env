# Purpose

This repo is simply an environment for me to experiment with using new features (new to me) of GitHub repos. One of our tasks is exploring DevOps (i.e., code operations) on Databricks. We have a shared repo for the class, but I didn't want to accidentally clutter that repo with problems.
